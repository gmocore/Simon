## If you want to try working on the code

1. We're currently working on the JS functionality.  Read the comments on the top of the JS file before working
2. Once you have an idea of what section you want to work on.  Please plan it out on a note or scratch paper
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b yourName-nameOfYourPlan`
4. Once your plan is complete and working it is time to commit and push
5. `git add .`
6. `git commit -m "Give us an explanation of what you did."`
7. `git push`
8. You will get an error saying it doesn't exist on the origin.  Copy/Paste the command it tells you to do
9. Contact Dan and we can work on the pull request
